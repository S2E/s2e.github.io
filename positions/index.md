##Open Positions

###Automated Testing Service for Device Drivers

Join us in building an open automated testing service for device
drivers. Drivers are the least reliable part of an OS kernel, and their
bugs routinely compromise the security and reliability of important
systems. We envision an online service where developers just upload the
device driver binary, click Test, and get back a list of bugs in the
driver along with tips on how to fix them. The back-end is based on S2E,
a powerful platform for program analysis that we've [already
used](http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/ddt.pdf) to find many serious bugs in MS
Windows certified device drivers. We now want to bring this technology
to the wide world.

We're looking for people who are exceptionally strong in computer
systems, love hacking both inside and outside an OS kernel, and have a
proven track record of building systems, contributing to open source
projects, etc. If C/C++ is your mother tongue and you're comfortable
coding at any layer in the software stack, [email
us](mailto:cristian.zamfir@epfl.ch) the following materials:

-   Résumé or Curriculum Vitae (please include descriptions of previous
    projects you have worked on);
-   If you graduated recently, a transcript of your grades in
    university;
-   Contact information (email+phone) for two references who have agreed
    to speak about you, your work, and your potential (please do not
    send us open letters of recommendation; we will directly contact
    your reference provider and solicit a confidential letter).

The work involves a cutting-edge mix of technologies (virtualization,
OSes, compilers, and cloud computing), and you'll be joining a small
team in Switzerland consisting of two senior PhDs from the [Dependable
Systems Lab](http://dslab.epfl.ch) at [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch).

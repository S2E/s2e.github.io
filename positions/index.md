##Open Positions

###Software Engineer

If you’re a hardcore systems programmer, are passionate about security,
and want to revolutionize the level of reliability and security in
systems software, let’s talk!

We’re starting a new project focused on using advanced program analysis
to defend IT assets against malware attacks. The project combines a mix
of cutting edge technologies, virtualization, OSes, compilers, and cloud
computing into a new way to ensure the safety and security of networks
and endpoints.

You’d be joining a close collaboration between a small research [team](http://dslab.epfl.ch/) at
[EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch) and an advanced software security startup located at the [EPFL
Innovation Park](http://epfl-innovationpark.ch/), on the shore of [Lake Geneva](http://www.prestige-voyages.com/sites/default/files/vm-j3-sur-les-rives-du-lac-leman.jpg). The project is sponsored
by the [Swiss Commission for Technology and Innovation](https://www.kti.admin.ch/kti/en/home.html).

We’re looking for people who are exceptionally strong in computer
systems, love hacking both inside and outside an OS kernel, and have
a proven track record of building systems, contributing to open
source projects, etc. If C/C++ is your mother tongue and you’re
comfortable coding at any layer in the software stack, [email](mailto:cristian.zamfir@epfl.ch) us
the following materials:

1. Resume or Curriculum Vitae (please include descriptions of previous
projects you have worked on);

2. Contact information (email + phone) for two references who have agreed
to speak about you, your work, and your potential. Please do not send us
open letters of recommendation; we will directly contact your reference
providers and solicit confidential feedback on you.

We evaluate candidates on an ongoing basis, so please submit the
materials as soon as they are available.
